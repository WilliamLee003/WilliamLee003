The difference between the LPS53 and NPS63-M-006: LPS53 can run the operation temperature from -40 °C to +80 °C and the NPS63-M-006 run the operation temperature from  0 °C to +80 °C. So the LPS53 can run in the lower temperature. LPS53’s inrush current is <60 A peak @ 230 Vac and NPS63-M-006 is < 50 A peak @ 230 Vac, which means that the LPS53 can endure more current to pass. Additionally, the efficiency of LPS53 is 80 - 85% typical at full load and NPS63-M-006 is 87% average. So compared to the LPS53, NPS63-M-006 can run more efficiently. But LPS53’s operation situation and change range are better than NPS63-M-006. So it’s up to your option.
